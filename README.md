# zest4096
Implementations of a 4096 bit hash based off of ChaCha

This is an attempt to make a hash function based off the recent ChaCha20 hash,
with a larger block and state size.

The implementations should have the hash function "zest4096", which when given one input,
should return the same output for all implementations posted.
